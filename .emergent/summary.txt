A full-stack application with a FastAPI backend and React frontend using a local MongoDB database. Most of the core features have been implemented, including a public site and a password-protected admin panel. Key features include JWT authentication, management of OPDs (with personnel counts and categories), a multi-step participation form with advanced location input, and a dynamic progress report page.

The user recently explored deploying the application externally to Railway/Vercel with MongoDB Atlas but encountered build issues. They have since decided to revert to hosting the application entirely within the Emergent platform. The agent successfully reverted the environment configuration and fixed resulting dependencies. The agent was in the middle of implementing new Agenda and Berita features when the session ended.

**Last working item**:
    - Last item agent was working: Implementing the Agenda and Berita (News) features. This involved creating new backend models and API endpoints, new admin pages for management, and new frontend components for display on the public homepage, including a news popup.

    Future Tasks:
    - **P2: Enhance OPD/Desa/Publik Management:** The agent suggested adding more detailed fields for Desa and Publik entries, such as contact person or full address, to make the data richer.
    - **P3: Alternative Admin Actions:** As the Aksi column was removed from the participation table, consider adding actions (like status change or deletion) back via a context menu (right-click) or a dedicated detail page for each participant.

**changes in tech stack**
  - The user decided against using an external database (MongoDB Atlas) and external hosting (Railway/Vercel), reverting to the fully managed Emergent environment with its local MongoDB.

**All files of reference**
- : Modified to include models and CRUD endpoints for Agenda and Berita.
- : Modified to include API functions for Agenda and Berita.
- : Modified to add sections for displaying Agenda and Berita.

- : A guide created for external deployment, which is no longer the current path but contains useful documentation.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
- The repository contains several configuration files for external deployment (, , , , ) which are now obsolete since the user reverted to Emergent's managed hosting. These could be removed to clean up the project root.
- The original concern about application instability due to high memory usage should be kept in mind. Although no crashes have occurred recently, a performance audit for unoptimized queries might be beneficial in the long run.

- **Database:** The application is connected to the local MongoDB instance provided by the platform.
- **Language:** All communication with the user MUST be in **Bahasa Indonesia**.
